# Tetranominoes
The [Tetranominoes tiling problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetromino#Tiling_the_rectangle_and_filling_the_box_with_2D_pieces) is a computing problem that is yet to have a optimised solution. The problem can be described as finding the suitable combination of tetranomino pieces to fill in a randomly generated map.
This algorithm utilises the principles of a greedy algorithm, achieving an average accuracy of around 96% with pseudo linear complexity in relation to the map size.
